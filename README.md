A command line webcam image grabber for Windows

CommandCam is a simple and easy to use command line webcam image grabber for Windows. 
It captures a single image from a webcam and stores it in a bitmap file. 
CommandCam is ideal for use in batch files and other situations where you want a very simple way to automate image capture. CommandCam uses Microsoft’s DirectShow API to access webcams, so it should work with most USB cameras.
